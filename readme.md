# D&D Resource Dashboard

Personal Project to help manage Dungeons & Dragons Resources, can help you manage locations, buildings, quests, traps, monsters and characters. More features always being built but currently extremely unstable and only meant for personal use.

This can also be used as a slide show app with the chrome cast, but would require your own appId to run.

This is not meant for public use at this point.

Built in Laravel 5.3, Angular 1.5, Jquery 1.1, Bootstrap 3.3
